| Project Idea |Pet care app  Description Pet care app (an app designed for pet owners to manage their pets. e.g. health records, vaccination schedules, grooming appointments, and diet plans, this could include features like tracking activities, setting reminders, connecting with local pet services, and veterinary surgery) I have checked a couple of pet apps and I noticed that they have the same problems which are you need to have a pet before you can get more information such as services and information around you without having to get a pet. take for example if I am looking to buy a pet but want to get more information about how to care for it, or local services around me for pets, or pet food and pet services around me, this app should be able to solve the problem and should include a feature that allows you to gather information about services, care around you. through other users' testimonies without having to register a pet.| teammate name | teammate name | teammate name | teammate name | teammate name | teammate name |
